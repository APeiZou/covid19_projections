Here we display a variety of maps generated based on our projections. All maps are updated daily.

Note that our infections estimate includes all infected individuals, not just those that took a COVID-19 test kit and tested positive. The vast majority of infected individuals do not get tested, and thus do not get reported as a positive case. As of June, we estimate the true number of infected individuals in the US is ~5x higher than the reported cases.
