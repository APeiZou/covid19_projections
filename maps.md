### Definitions
- *Infections:* Number of all infected individuals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not just those that took a COVID-19 test and tested positive. The vast majority of infected individuals in our estimate do not get tested, and thus do not get reported as a positive case. As of June, we estimate the true number of infected individuals in the US is ~5x higher than the reported cases.
- *Currently infected:* Percentage of the population that are actively carrying the virus on the given date. We assume an average recovery time of 15 days.
- *Total infected:* Percentage of the population that are currently infected or have been infected at some point, by a given date.
- *Total deaths:* Total deaths per 1 million people by a given date.
- *Additional deaths:* Additional deaths per 1 million people from today until the projected date.
