# Projections Data

Here, you will find all of our projections based on the date the projectoins were generated. Under each date directory, you will find a .csv file for each individual state/region/country. You can also look under our `combined` directory to see all of our daily projections combined in a single file.

# Evaluation

When evaluating our projections, please keep in mind the following notes and update log:

* Our estimates from early April do not incorporate reopenings and probable deaths, two factors that significantly increases the estimates. Furthermore, our early April projections only go through June.

* We send projections to the CDC every Monday using Sunday's data. For example, April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, etc. As a result, we recommend using those projections for evaluation, since those have the highest impact and were the most carefully vetted.

* We did not submit our first projections to the CDC until April 20. While we welcome an evaluation of every projection we have ever made, we also want to point out that our projections have been constantly evolving/improving, and it wasn't until April 20 that we felt confident enough in our projections to submit to the CDC. With that said, we fully stand behind every projection we have sent to the CDC.

* One way to think of this is to view our projections starting on April 20 as the "release" version, while projections prior to April 20 were "beta" versions.
