title: COVID-19 Infections Tracker
permalink: /infections-tracker/
---

Our model tries to do what no other model currently does (to the best of our knowledge): provide an estimate for the true number of infected individuals in every region.

**Please Note: The infections estimate includes ALL infected people, not just those that took a coronavirus test kit and tested positive.** The vast majority of infested individuals did NOT get tested due to 1) lack of available testing, 2) they are only mildly symptomatic or 3) they do not know they are carrying the virus. For example, if the US reported 30,000 new cases, we estimate the true number of infected people to be likely 4-8x higher.

## Projected State Recoveries
#### When will each state have fewer than X,000 total infected individuals at a given time?

We hope the below chart will provide a useful reference in estimating when a state will have recovered sufficiently for restrictions to be eased. As a comparison, at the time when China lifted the lockdown in Wuhan on Apr 8, there were an estimated 3000 infected individuals.

Lifting stay-at-home orders while there are still a high number of infected individuals present may cause a resurgence in cases, as we are currently witnessing in several Asian countries.

Click on each state below to see a detailed graph of the number of COVID-19 infected individuals over time for that state.
