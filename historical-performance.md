# Historical Performance

On this page, we present a weekly evaluation of our model's historical performance along with other models in the [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). The forecasts from these models are sent to the CDC weekly and presented on the [CDC COVID-19 Forecasting page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).

We have open-sourced the code and output used to generate these evaluations [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation/#methods). We believe in a fully transparent evaluation methodology, and publicly releasing all of our code and data is the best way to do so.

[Click here](/model-comparison-ihme) to see some sample plots of our past projections.

The charts below represent past state-by-state and US projections evaluated on cumulative deaths on the specified evaluation date (June 20, June 13, etc). As the charts may be outdated, please consult our [evaluation page](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation) for the latest data.
