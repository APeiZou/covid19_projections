## Model Comparison with IHME

On this page, we show several plots comparing our projections with the [IHME](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) model.

## Old Comparisons of Projections for August 4

**As of May 4, we are no longer updating this page. Please see our [About](/about/#concerns-with-the-ihme-model) to see most recent comparisons with the IHME model.**

We will compare our daily projections with the [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) for five of the most heavily-impacted regions: US, New York, Michigan, Italy, and France. Note that while we update our projections daily, IHME only updates their projections 2-3 times a week.

See [here](https://covid19-projections.com/about/#concerns-with-the-ihme-model) for a comparison of our historical projections and why we think the IHME model is flawed.

### Notes

A ~~strikethrough~~ means that the current deaths have already exceeded the total projected deaths as of May 4.

\* Starting on April 15, we assume a relaxing of social distancing in US and Europe starting on June 1, leading to higher projections.

^ Starting on April 23, we include probable deaths in our US projections, following new [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) from April 14 onwards to include both confirmed and probable deaths.
