# Utah - County Infection Estimates

See state-wide estimates [here](/infections/us-ut).

Click on a county name to view the infections estimates for that county.

*Note: Due to the inherent lag between infections and reporting of cases, our estimates of infections are as of 14 days ago.*

*Last updated: January 7, 2021*

**Utah Note**: Some Utah counties do not report data because they report cases by [local health departments](https://ualhd.org/) rather than by county.
