# COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning

My name is Youyang Gu and I am a data scientist. I used machine learning to develop a model that attempts to project COVID-19 deaths in the US and around the world. There are a lot of existing models out there already that attempts to make projections, but I believe that there are shortcomings in those models that could be improved upon. I want to utilize a data-centric approach to this problem.

Every day, I will upload my raw daily projections for all US 50 states [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/projections). The projections will be updated daily based on new data. You can also view the projections in a chart format below.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter via [@youyanggu](https://twitter.com/youyanggu) with any questions/insights/feedback. You can also find me [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youyanggu/).

_Note_: While we attempt to predict the _official_ death total, the true death total may be higher due underreporting at various levels.
