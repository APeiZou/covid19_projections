# COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning

[covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/)

We take a data-driven approach rooted in epidemiology to forecast infections and deaths for the COVID-19 / coronavirus epidemic in the US and around the world

You can download the raw daily projections by clicking on the [`projections`](/projections) folder.

As June 22, we have open-sourced the underlying SEIR simulator used to generate these projections: https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator.

Reich forecasts follow the format specified by the [Reich Lab](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub).

Our projections are featured on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).
