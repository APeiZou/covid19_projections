# COVID-19 Projections

I used machine learning to develop a model that attempts to project COVID-19 deaths in the US. There are a lot of existing models out there already, but I believe that there are flaws in those models that could be improved upon. I want to utilize a data-heavy approach to this problem, rather than an epidemiologic approach. I will upload my daily projections for all US 50 states. The projections will be updated daily based on new data.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter via @youyanggu with any questions/insights/feedback.
