# COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning

I used machine learning to develop a model that attempts to project COVID-19 deaths in the US. There are a lot of existing models out there already, but I believe that there are flaws in those models that could be improved upon. I want to utilize a data-centric approach to this problem, rather than an epidemiologic approach. I will upload my daily projections for all US 50 states [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections). The projections will be updated daily based on new data.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter via [@youyanggu](https://twitter.com/youyanggu) with any questions/insights/feedback.

_Note_: While we attempt to predict the _official_ death total, the true death total may be higher due underreporting at various levels.
