## Help support an unbiased, rigorous, data-driven approach to COVID-19

{% include iframe_donate.html %}

*covid19-projections.com* is entirely built and run by myself, [Youyang Gu](https://youyanggu.com). Since April, I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time to making sure that people have the best data possible to make informed decisions.

Having your support would make my job much easier and allow me to focus full-time on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, until [normality returns](/path-to-herd-immunity).

With your donation, I can:

- Continue to work on *covid19-projections.com* full-time
- Pay for dedicated hosting and computing
- Expand research efforts
- Increase reach
- Fight misinformation
- Inspire further action

## We do more with less

You can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.

Any excess funds will be saved for future public health modeling efforts. I hope to eventually expand upon my COVID-19 work to continue to present the same unbiased, rigorous, and data-driven approach to public health.
