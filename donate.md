# Donate

*covid19-projections.com* is built and run by me, [Youyang](https://youyanggu.com). I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time since April 2020. Since I created the site, I have not relied on any outside funding whatsoever. Unfortunately, this is unsustainable. I briefly [stepped back](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later) in October, only to be drawn back a month later due to the rising urgency of the fall wave.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, hopefully until [herd immunity is reached](/path-to-herd-immunity). Having your support would make my job much easier and allow me to focus solely on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

*I do not like asking for money, but hopefully this time it will be worth it.*
