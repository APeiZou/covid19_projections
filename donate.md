*covid19-projections.com* is built and run by me, [Youyang](https://youyanggu.com). I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time since April 2020. Since I created *covid19-projections.com* in April 2020, I have not relied on any outside funding whatsoever. Unfortunately, this is unsustainable. I briefly [stepped back](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later) in October, only to be drawn back a month later due to the rising urgency of the fall wave.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project until [herd immunity is reached](/path-to-herd-immunity). Having your support would make my job much easier and make it easier for me to focus solely on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

## Support our efforts to provide a unbiased, data-driven approach to COVID-19

## We do more with less

You can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.
