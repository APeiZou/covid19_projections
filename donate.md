# Support covid19-projections.com

*covid19-projections.com* is built and run by me, [Youyang](https://youyanggu.com). I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time since April 2020 to making sure that people have the best data possible to make informed decisions. Since I created the site, I have not relied on any outside funding. Unfortunately, this is unsustainable. I briefly [stepped back](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later) in October, only to be drawn back a month later due to the rising urgency of the fall wave.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, hopefully until [herd immunity is reached](/path-to-herd-immunity). Having your support would make my job much easier and allow me to focus solely on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

### Please help support our efforts to provide a unbiased, data-driven approach to COVID-19

With your donation, I can:

- Pay for dedicated hosting and computing
- Expand research efforts
- Increase reach
- Fight back against misinformation
- Inspire further action

**We do more with less** - you can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.

Any excess funds will be saved for future public health modeling efforts. I hope to eventually expand upon my COVID-19 work to continue to present an unbiased, rigorous, and data-driven approach to public health. If you would like to get involved, please [reach out](https://youyanggu.com/contact).
