# Support covid19-projections.com

*covid19-projections.com* is entirely built and run by myself, [Youyang Gu](https://youyanggu.com). Since April 2020, I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time to making sure that people have the best data possible to make informed decisions. For eight months, I have not relied on any outside funding. Unfortunately, this is not quite sustainable. I briefly [stepped back](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later) in October, only to be drawn back a month later due to the rising urgency of the fall wave.

Having your support would make my job much easier and allow me to focus full-time on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis. I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, until [normally returns](/path-to-herd-immunity).

### Please help support my efforts in providing a unbiased, rigorous, data-driven approach to COVID-19

With your donation, I can:

- Continue to work on *covid19-projections.com* full-time
- Pay for dedicated hosting and computing
- Expand research efforts
- Increase reach
- Fight misinformation
- Inspire further action

**We do more with less** - you can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.
