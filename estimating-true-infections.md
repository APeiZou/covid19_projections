# Estimating True Infections

Knowing the true number of people who are infected with COVID-19 in the US is an essential step towards understanding the disease. But estimating this number is not a simple task. The true number of infections is many times larger than the reported number of cases in the US, because the majority of people do not get tested due to several reasons: 1) they are asymptomatic, 2) they are only mildly symptomatic or 3) they do not have easy access to testing.

On this page, we will present two different, independent methods to estimate true number of people infected with COVID-19 in the US:

1. Based on confirmed cases ([Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)) + test positivity rate ([COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/))
2. Based on confirmed deaths ([Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series))

Both methods yield a similar result: the true number of infections peaked at around 400-500k new infections per day in July, compared to 300k new infections per day in March.

## Method #1: Using Confirmed Cases + Positivity Rate

The core idea behind this method is that we can use the positivity rate to roughly determine the ratio of true infections to reported cases. The hypothesis is that as positivity rate increases, the higher the true prevalence in a region relative to the reported cases. This also makes sense intuitively: if you test everyone, then the positvity rate will be very low, and you will catch every case. But if testing is not widely available, then you will catch only the severe cases, resulting in a high positivity rate.

We believe that the relationship between positivity rate and ratio of true prevalence is monotonically increasing. Of course, the exact relationship varies from state to state and across time. But if one were to take the average across *all* of the data, one can generate a theoretical curve. We believe this relationship can be approximated by a root function, namely the square root function. We present our estimate below.

`prevalence-ratio = 16 * sqrt(positivity-rate) + 2.5`

The next step is to map all reported cases to true infections based on the true prevalence ratio. We can compute the true prevalence ratio simply by providing the positivity rate into the function above. For all computation purposes, we use the 7-day average of confirmed cases and positivty rates. Because reported cases lag true infections by roughly 2 weeks, we shift the result by two weeks to get an estimate of the true new infections on that day.

### Using State-by-state Cases + Positivity Rate

## Method #2: Using Confirmed Deaths

The first method is the method used by *covid19-projections.com*. It uses only past reported deaths to predict future reported deaths. You can read more about our model on our [About](/about) page.

One of the outputs generated by our model is the number of true infections in each region and country. We simply take that output from our model to get our estimate of true infections in the US.

## Putting it Together

We can now plot the two methods together and see how they compare. Note that they follow roughly the same shape and magnitude. We try to explan the differences below;

- On average, cases were detected later in March/April compared to June/July. As a result, the plot of infections based on cases lag in March/April and lead in June/July, compared to estimate generated by only deaths data.

## Discussion

There are many explanations as to why there are more infections in June/July than in March/April. One reason is based on simple math regarding exponential growth. We started from 0 infections in February with an R0 of ~2.5. There was only a limited period of exponential growth before people began social distancing in March, which brought the Rt value under 1. The stay-at-home orders in most parts of the US were timely and effective in containing the spread and preventing further uncontained spread.

In contrast, when states reopened in May/June, there were already ~100k new infections per day. With an Rt of ~1.2 and limited intervention to mitigate the spread, new infections were able to climb to 400k+ per day in a period of 2 months.

### Lower Infection Fatality Rate

Below are a few reasons why we think the infection fatality rate (IFR) has gone down since March/April.

- Improved treatment (new drugs, better allocation of resources, more experience among staff, etc)
- Better protection of vulnerable populations ([nearly half](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-deaths-in-u-s-nursing-long-term-care-facilities-top-50-000-11592306919) of all deaths in March/April were in care homes)
- Lower median age of infection
- Earlier detection
