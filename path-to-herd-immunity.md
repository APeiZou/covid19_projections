# Path to Herd Immunity: 2021 Outlook of COVID-19 in the US

Below, we present our current best estimate of the path to COVID-19 herd immunity in the United States, given what we currently know about the available vaccines and infection rates. Herd immunity will be reached through immunity from two sources: vaccination and infection.

## Summary
- We believe herd immunity (>60% immune) will be reached in the US by late summer/early fall 2021 (September-November 2021).
- At the time herd immunity is reached, roughly half of the immunity will be achieved via infection, and the other half will be achieved via vaccination.
- New COVID-19 infections may become negligible before herd immunity is reached. Our current best estimate is summer 2021 (July-September 2021).
- As a result of the above findings, our best estimate of a complete "return to normal" is late summer 2021 (August-October 2021).

The underlying assumptions behind our estimates are presented below.

## Basic Assumptions

- We assume immunity can be achieved through either infection or vaccination.
- We assume herd immunity is achieved when at least 60% of the population are immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to population heterogeneity and variation in susceptibility, it is possible that the herd immunity threhsold can be lower.

## Vaccination Assumptions

- We currently model the rollout of two vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. There will be more vaccines in 2021 (e.g. Johnson & Johnson), but by then we believe supply will no longer be the bottleneck.
- We assume roughly 60% of the US population will take at least one dose of the vaccine by the end of 2021.
- We assume an individual has been inoculated/vaccinated after they receive the first of two doses. However, in reality, an individual may still susceptible for the first few weeks following the first dose.
- We assume a 85% vaccine efficacy. While the trial data demonstrate >90% efficacy, we believe that the efficacy in the general population will be lower, mainly due to the fact that a sizable proportion of the population will likely miss the second vaccine dose.
- We assume vaccinations will begin in mid-December following the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval.
- We assume a smooth vaccine rollout (no major issues or halts)
- We assume a proportion of the vaccinated population already possess immunity via infection. For simplicity, this proportion is equal to the percentage of the population that have immunity via infection. If an individual possesses immunity from both vaccination and infection, we do not count this individual as "immune via vaccination".
- We compute the population "immune via vaccination" by taking the total vaccinated, subtracing the estimated number of individuals who already possess immunity via infection, and multiplying the resulting number by the vaccine efficacy (85%).

## Infection Assumptions

- We assume roughly 17% of the population have been infected as of mid-December.
- We assume a small proportion of the infected population (~10%) will lose their immunity over time.
- We assume that the infection rate will fall as the number of individuals who are inoculated/vaccinated increases.
- We assume infections will decrease from mid-December 2020 to February 2021. We account for the possibility of another wave of infections in late winter (February-March).
- We compute the population "immune via infection" by taking the total number of infected individuals and subtracing the estimated number of individuals who lost their immunity.
