# Path to Herd Immunity: 2021 Outlook of COVID-19 in the US

*Last Updated: December 9, 2020*

Below, we present our current best estimate of the US path to COVID-19 herd immunity, given what we currently know about the available vaccines and the infection rates. Herd immunity will be reached via immunity from two sources: vaccination and infection.

## Vaccination Assumptions

- We currently model two vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. There may be more vaccines in 2021 (e.g. Johnson & Johnson), but by then we believe supply will no longer be the bottleneck.
- We assume roughly 60% of the US population will take the vaccine by the end of 2021.
- We assume 85% vaccine efficacy. While the trial data demonstrate >90% efficacy, we believe that the efficacy in the general population will be lower, mainly due to the fact that a sizable proportion of the population will likely miss the second vaccine dose.
- We assume vaccinations will begin in mid-December following FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval.
- We assume an individual has been vaccinated when they receive the first of two doses. In reality, an individual is still susceptible for the first few weeks following the first dose.
- We assume a proportion of the vaccinated population already possess immunity via infection (for simplicity, this proportion is equal to the percentage of the population that have immunity via infection)
- We compute the population "immune via vaccination" by taking the total vaccinated

## Infection Assumptions

- We assume infections will decrease from mid-December to February. We account for the possibility of another wave of infections in late winter (February-March).
- We assume that the infection rate will fall as the number of people who get vaccinated increases.
