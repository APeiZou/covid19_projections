# Path to Herd Immunity: 2021 Outlook of COVID-19 in the US

With the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine in the horizon, we present our best current estimate of the path to COVID-19 herd immunity in the United States. Herd immunity will be reached through immunity from two sources: vaccination and natural infection.

## Summary
- We believe COVID-19 herd immunity (>60% of population immune) will be reached in the US by summer 2021 (Jun-Aug 2021).
- At the time herd immunity is reached, roughly half of the immunity will be achieved through natural infection, and the other half will be achieved through vaccination.
- New COVID-19 infections may become negligible before herd immunity is reached. Our current best estimate of when daily community transmissions will drop below 1,000 per day is early summer 2021 (Jun-Aug 2021).
- Summarizing the above findings, our best estimate of a complete "return to normal" in the US is mid to late summer 2021 (Jul-Sep 2021).
- We estimate around one-third of the US population (~110 million) will have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of 2021. That is an additional 40 million infections since mid-December 2020.
- This translates to a final US COVID-19 death toll of roughly 500,000 (+/-100k) reported deaths, or ~200,000 additional deaths since mid-December 2020.

## Disclaimers

- This writeup has not been peer-reviewed in an academic journal.
- The author is not an epidemiologist.
- The results presented here are merely estimates based on a set of assumptions, so please use caution when utilizing the results.
- If any of the assumptions used to generate these estimates do not hold, then the results may be drastically different.
- These estimates are subject to change based on new data/evidence.

## Assumptions

The underlying assumptions behind our estimates are presented below:

### Basic Assumptions

- We assume immunity can be achieved through either natural infection or vaccination.
- We assume herd immunity is achieved when at least 60% of the population possess immunity from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (HIT = 60%). Due to population heterogeneity and variation in susceptibility, it is possible that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) can be lower.
- **Important:** We only count the immunity that was acquired first (e.g. if an individual has both immunity from natural infection and immunity from vaccination, we only count the immunity from infection).
- We only use publicly available data.

### Vaccination Assumptions

- **Important:** We assume an individual has been vaccinated after they receive the first of two doses. However, in reality, an individual may still be susceptible for the first 1-4 weeks following the first dose. We assume the majority of individuals (but not all) will receive the second dose.
- We currently model the initial rollout of two vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. More vaccines will be approved in 2021 (e.g. Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca), but by then we do not believe supply will the bottleneck. Hence, we do not believe that the introduction of additional vaccines in 2021 will significantly affect vaccine uptake rates.
- We assume roughly two-thirds of the US population will take at least one dose of the vaccine by the end of 2021. This is slightly higher than the 50% vaccine coverage for the common flu.
- We assume a 85% vaccine efficacy. While the trial data demonstrate >90% efficacy, we believe that the efficacy in the general population will be slightly lower due to the fact that a sizable proportion of the population may miss the second vaccine dose.
- We assume vaccinations will begin in mid-December following the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval.
- Many of the assumptions in this writeup come from the [December 10 FDA Briefing Document](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) for the Pfizer vaccine.
- We assume the general population will begin receiving vaccinations in late spring/early summer (Apr-Jun 2021). We assume children will begin receiving vaccinations in late summer/early fall (Aug-Oct 2021).
- We assume a smooth vaccine rollout (no major issues or halts).
- We assume a proportion of the vaccinated population already possess immunity via infection. For simplicity, this proportion is equal to the percentage of the population that have immunity via infection. If an individual possesses immunity from both vaccination and infection, we do not count this individual as "immune via vaccination".
- We compute the population "immune via vaccination" by taking the total vaccinated, subtracting the estimated number of individuals who already possess immunity via infection, and multiplying the resulting number by the vaccine efficacy (85%).

### Infection Assumptions

- We assume roughly 66 million people in the US (20% of the population) have already been infected by the time the vaccine is authorized in mid-December 2020. We assume ~99.95% of these individuals possess immunity as of mid-December 2020.
- We assume a small proportion (~10%) of the infected population will lose their immunity by the end of 2021. Most of the loss in immunity happens more than a year after infection.
- If an individual loses immunity but gets vaccinated, they are counted as "immune via vaccination".
- We assume that the infection rate will fall as the number of individuals who are inoculated/vaccinated increases.
- We assume infections will decrease from mid-December 2020 to February 2021. We account for the possibility of another wave of infections in late winter (February-March).
- We use a basic SEIR model to estimate infections over time.
- We compute the population "immune via infection" by taking the total number of infected individuals and subtracting the estimated number of individuals who lost their immunity.

## Corollaries

- Our estimates show that roughly one-third of the US population (~110 million) will have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of 2021. That is an additional 40 million infections since mid-December 2020.
- A 30% prevalence estimate translates to a final US COVID-19 death toll of roughly 400,000 to 600,000 reported deaths, with 500,000 deaths being the best estimate. Given a mid-December 2020 death toll of 300,000, that is an additional 200,000 deaths. This estimate may change if the assumptions presented above are no longer true (e.g. deaths will be lower if vaccine rollout is faster than expected; deaths will be higher if the efficacy is lower than expected).
- Due to the high prevalence, a targeted approach for vaccination that prioritizes individuals who are more likely to be susceptible may improve the time to reach herd immunity.
- Due to possible low vaccine acceptance/uptake and waning immunity from natural infection, it is possible that the US will not reach immunity levels above 70%. In most scenarios, even 50-70% immunity should be sufficient to prevent new outbreaks.
