# Implied IFR

**New July 29**: This is still a work in progress - stay tuned for updates.

Here we introduce the concept of implied infection fatality rate (IIFR), and present the raw data used to compute the IIFR. IIFR is a metric computed by taking a regionâ€™s reported deaths and dividing it by the true infections estimate (after accounting for the lag). Knowing the true number of people who are infected with COVID-19 in the US is an essential step towards understanding the disease.
