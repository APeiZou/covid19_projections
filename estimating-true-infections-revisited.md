In July 2020, we released a report, *[Estimating True Infections: A Simple Heuristic to Measure Implied Infection Fatality Rate](/estimating-true-infections)*. We described a simple heuristic that can be used to estimate true infections for every state in the US based on the confirmed cases and test positivity rate. Now, in November 2020, we are posting a revision of the methods based on new data that have come to light over the course of the past four months.
