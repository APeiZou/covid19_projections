## Maps

Here you will find maps of our infection estimates. We recommend viewing these maps on the browser or in landscape mode. For the county maps, you can zoom by double clicking.

*Looking for the old (pre-November) iteration of the Maps page? [Click here](/maps).*

For a larger view of the county-by-county maps, see the two links below:
* [US Counties Currently Infected](/infections/map_county_current_infected)
* [US Counties Total Infected](/infections/map_county_total_infected)

*Note: Some Utah counties do not have infections estimates available because they report cases by [local health departments](https://ualhd.org/) rather than by county.*
