## Maps

Here you will find maps of our infection estimates. If you're viewing from a mobile device, we recommend viewing these maps on the browser or in landscape mode.

**New Feature (Nov 30):** Drag the slider at the bottom of each map to see how the values change over time.

For county-level maps, visit the links below:
* [US Counties Currently Infected](/infections/map_county_current_infected) ([time lapse](/infections/map_slider_county_current_infected))
* [US Counties Total Infected](/infections/map_county_total_infected) ([time lapse](/infections/map_slider_county_total_infected))

*Note: Some Utah counties do not have infections estimates available because they report cases by [local health departments](https://ualhd.org/) rather than by county.*

*Looking for the old (pre-November 2020) iteration of the Maps page? [Click here](/maps).*
